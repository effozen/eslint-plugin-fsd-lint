# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge
We, as members, contributors, and leaders, pledge to make participation in our  
project and our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age,  
body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience,  
education, socioeconomic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion,  
or sexual identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming,  
diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Standards
Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment:
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
- Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
- Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other community members
- Acknowledging and valuing diverse contributions

Examples of unacceptable behavior:
- The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome advances
- Trolling, insulting, or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing othersâ€™ private information without explicit permission
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Enforcement Responsibilities
Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying and enforcing  
the standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair  
corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate,  
threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope
This Code of Conduct applies within all project spaces, including GitHub discussions,  
code reviews, pull requests, and any other communication channels directly associated  
with the project.

## Reporting Issues
Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported  
by contacting the project team at **[ashgrayblue0@gmail.com](mailto:ashgrayblue0@gmail.com)**.  
All complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response  
that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances.

## Enforcement
Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good faith  
may face temporary or permanent repercussions, determined by other maintainers.

## Attribution
